## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Animation
- Position in CSS


### What I learned

transform
The transform CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element. It modifies the coordinate space of the CSS, transform properties include:

transform: matrix(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0);
transform: matrix3d(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1);
transform: perspective(17px);
transform: rotate(0.5turn);
transform: rotate3d(1, 2.0, 3.0, 10deg);
transform: rotateX(10deg);
transform: rotateY(10deg);
transform: rotateZ(10deg);
transform: translate(12px, 50%);
transform: translate3d(12px, 50%, 3em);
transform: translateX(2em);
transform: translateY(3in);
transform: translateZ(2px);
transform: scale(2, 0.5);
transform: scale3d(2.5, 1.2, 0.3);
transform: scaleX(2);
transform: scaleY(0.5);
transform: scaleZ(0.3);
transform: skew(30deg, 20deg);
transform: skewX(30deg);
transform: skewY(1.07rad);

Well dont bother in trying to know all atleat my self got familiar with the most properties i feel will be relevant in designing accessible sites; rotate, translate, and scale.

Using CSS animations
CSS animations make it possible to animate transitions from one CSS style configuration to another. Animations consist of two components, a style describing the CSS animation and a set of keyframes that indicate the start and end states of the animation's style, as well as possible intermediate waypoints.
You would find my used in the code snipet below beside it the primary purpose of this design to get hand on animation 

Using media queries
Media queries are useful when you want to modify your site or app depending on a device's general type (such as print vs. screen) or specific characteristics and parameters (such as screen resolution or browser viewport width).

To conditionally apply styles with the CSS @media and @import at-rules.
as seen in the code snipet below;


```
.animeTyre {
  
    transform: translateX(-50%);
    
}
```
```
.animeRoad {
    background-repeat: repeat-x;
    animation: road 10s linear infinite;
}
```
```
@keyframes road {
    100% {
        transform: translateX(-3200px);
    }
}
```
```
media (min-width:320px) and (max-width: 768px){
    .animeMotor {
        width: 250px;
        bottom: 127px;
    }
```
    


### Continued development

- Animation 
- Transform 
- Mediaqueries


### Useful resources

- [mozilla fire fox 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [mozilla fire fox resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations) - This is an amazing article which helped me really understanding media queries transform and animation as regards @keyframes. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
